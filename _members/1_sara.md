I am currently an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning in Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2015 from UC Berkeley where I was advised by Yun S. Song. My research areas include computational and population genetics, with a focus on demographic inference and natural selection. I am generally interested in developing statistical and machine learning methods for problems in biology.
