I am currently an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning in Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to joining Penn in 2025, I spent 10 years as a faculty member at liberal arts colleges. In 2015 I received my PhD in Computer Science from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) where I was advised by [Yun S. Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). My research areas include computational and population genetics, with a focus on demographic inference and natural selection. I am generally interested in developing statistical and machine learning methods for problems in evolutionary biology.
